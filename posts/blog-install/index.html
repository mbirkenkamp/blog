But as i later found a guide in the Hugo Documentation that is could simply use github pages for free, i went with that.\nCustomizing Theme after digging through the themes section of hugo for 10 minutes i decided to use PaperMod because i wanted a clean look and light and dark mode, there were a couple of candidates that fit the bill, but PaperMod was the most reduced and not ‚Äúretro‚Äù one i found.\nConfig now i was greeted with the generated config.yml of hugo and PaperMod, that i tried to strip down to my liking, since i wanted to start with the bare minimum and add things later if the need arises (this is helpful no matter what i learn, since i can easily get caught up in details). This was a pretty straightforward but tedious task, since i had to consult the documentation numerous times, additionally i was a little uncertain how i would be able to remove the icon in the top right corner, since i had no good icon for this blog (nor am i certain there ever will be). In the end my fears were unfounded, because i started to delete line after line of the config and hugo was gracefully deactivating these features without errors or even warnings (great job, hugo team!).\nProblems!!!!! live reloading not working when i was writing this article i noticed that i needed to restart the server to see the changes in my browser, which is not great but would not be a dealbreaker either, but as far is i understood the documentation and the messages during startup, this should work: Watching for changes in /blog/{archetypes,content,data,layouts,static,themes}\nSo i tried to get more info about the source of this, i stumbled upon this issue which seems to concern the same problem but was fixed and closed in 2020, so this didn‚Äôt help.\nI tried a couple of command line arguments from the hugo server cli doc (-w,‚ÄìdisableLiveReload, -D, -F, -v etc.) but nothing changed the behaviour, the next thing that got into my head was that maybe the changes were not ‚Äúseen‚Äù by the server since i start the server in Windows 11‚Äôs Subsystem for Linux, but change the posts using GitHub - marktext/marktext: üìùA simple and elegant markdown editor, available for Linux, macOS and Windows. on windows directly, so i touched the files on zsh, but nothing changed.\nSolution (bittersweet) unfortunatelly i didn‚Äôt not find the source of this problem, but i was able to fix it by supplying --poll 1sto my server start command, now it worked perfectly (even better than i thought since changes are now shown directly in the browser, not as i anticipated when i reload the browser tab)\nThe biggest Question so what should i write about, since i basically have nothing new to write? I‚Äôm not involved in any mailing lists where the latest technologies are discussed and i sit on no board where the fate of the internet is shaped or new RFCs/HTML Features/JCRs are proposed (i mean i COULD participate in all this if i wanted to, since this is all done in the open, but‚Ä¶). So i really only blindly follow the medium post from the ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù section and hope to get something out of this for me during this journey, maybe i will become a better communicator, maybe this will lead to me writing 5 best selling novels, but maybe this will all be for nothing, so we‚Äôll see.\n","wordCount":"894","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-09T21:08:00+02:00","dateModified":"2022-04-09T21:08:00+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mbirkenkamp.github.io/blog/posts/blog-install/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"mbirkenkamps blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mbirkenkamp.github.io/blog/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p>it all started with the blog post <a href=https://medium.com/blankpage/8-reasons-why-you-should-blog-as-a-developer-4bc8e7e87c71>8 Reasons Why You Should Blog as a Developer</a> and especially the point about communicating clearly, which is becoming more and more important to me as my role shifts from &ldquo;doer&rdquo; to &ldquo;enabler&rdquo;.

<p>Additionally i wanted to explore static site generators, so this was the perfect way to do this.</p>
<h1 id=how>How?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how>#</a></h1>
<p>my dream setup would be to have a templating engine for basic look and feel and an easy way to write new content/posts, so i looked around which static site generators would suit this need the best.</p>

<h2 id=jekyll--hugo>Jekyll & Hugo<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#jekyll--hugo>#</a></h2>
<p>so i was down to the last 2 Contenders: Jekyll & Hugo.</p>
<p>they both seemed pretty similar in using themes as template for the site and simple Markdown files to create content, the CLI seemed simple enough, so everything i needed, i could&rsquo;ve gone either way but ended up choosing Hugo, just because the website was nicer to my eyes, so it was a strict assessment about the capabilities ;).</p>

<p>since this is more a learning journey than something anybody should read, the hosting should above all be free, so i searched for small hosting solutions to find the least expensive way to host this blog, i settled on a provider that would&rsquo;ve cost about 1‚Ç¨ a month and could&rsquo;ve used my existing domain with it.

<p>after digging through the themes section of hugo for 10 minutes i decided to use <a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/>PaperMod</a> because i wanted a clean look and light and dark mode, there were a couple of candidates that fit the bill, but PaperMod was the most reduced and not &ldquo;retro&rdquo; one i found.</p>

<h2 id=live-reloading-not-working>live reloading not working<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#live-reloading-not-working>#</a></h2>
<p>when i was writing this article i noticed that i needed to restart the server to see the changes in my browser, which is not great but would not be a dealbreaker either, but as far is i understood the documentation and the messages during startup, this should work: <code>Watching for changes in &lt;gitdir>/blog/{archetypes,content,data,layouts,static,themes}</code></p>
<p>So i tried to get more info about the source of this, i stumbled upon this <a href=https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/hugo-server-not-refreshing-with-content-change/23858>issue</a> which seems to concern the same problem but was fixed and closed in 2020, so this didn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of command line arguments from the <a href=https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/>hugo server cli doc</a> (-w,&ndash;disableLiveReload, -D, -F, -v etc.) but nothing changed the behaviour, the next thing that got into my head was that maybe the changes were not &ldquo;seen&rdquo; by the server since i start the server in Windows 11&rsquo;s Subsystem for Linux, but change the posts using <a href=https://github.com/marktext/marktext>GitHub - marktext/marktext: üìùA simple and elegant markdown editor, available for Linux, macOS and Windows.</a> on windows directly, so i touched the files on zsh, but nothing changed.</p>
<h3 id=solution-bittersweet>Solution (bittersweet)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#solution-bittersweet>#</a></h3>
<p>unfortunatelly i didn&rsquo;t not find the source of this problem, but i was able to fix it by supplying <code>--poll 1s</code>to my server start command, now it worked perfectly (even better than i thought since changes are now shown directly in the browser, not as i anticipated when i reload the browser tab)</p>
<h1 id=the-biggest-question>The biggest Question<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-biggest-question>#</a></h1>
<p>so what should i write about, since i basically have nothing new to write? I&rsquo;m not involved in any mailing lists where the latest technologies are discussed and i sit on no board where the fate of the internet is shaped or new RFCs/HTML Features/JCRs are proposed (i mean i COULD participate in all this if i wanted to, since this is all done in the open, but&mldr;). So i really only blindly follow the medium post from the &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; section and hope to get something out of this for me during this journey, maybe i will become a better communicator, maybe this will lead to me writing 5 best selling novels, but maybe this will all be for nothing, so we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

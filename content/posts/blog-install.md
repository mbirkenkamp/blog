# Why?

it all started with the blog post [8 Reasons Why You Should Blog as a Developer](https://medium.com/blankpage/8-reasons-why-you-should-blog-as-a-developer-4bc8e7e87c71) and especially the point about communicating clearly, which is becoming more and more important to me as my role shifts from "doer" to "enabler". So it is more important to effectivly instruct others then doing stuff myself.

Additionally i wanted to explore static site generators, so this was the perfect way to do this.

# How?

my dream setup would be to have a templating engine for basic look and feel and an easy way to write new content/posts, so i looked around which static site generators would suit this need the best.

# The Contenders

## Nuxt & Next.js

I deemed these overkill since these Options are based on React/Vue.js, which i have no use for in my blog, since more tech normally leads to a more complex and powerfull solution, this was not what i needed.

## Gatsby

Gatsby seems to be a very complete solution for CMS/Webapp development, but seems to heavily lean towards plugins and extensibility, so i deemed it too complex for my simple blog.

## Jekyll & Hugo

so i was down to the last 2 Contenders: Jekyll & Hugo.

they both seemed pretty similar in using themes as template for the site and simple Markdown files to create content, the CLI seemed simple enough, so everything i needed, i could've gone either way but ended up choosing Hugo, just because the website was nicer to my eyes, so it was a strict assessment about the capabilities ;).

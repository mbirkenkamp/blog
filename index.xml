      <description>WHUT??? the world (not only the developers) has been introduced to the latest step in AI hype: ChatGPT, it gathered widespread media attention not during its initial release in December 2022 but in the beginning of 2023. After a couple of years where AI and ML Advancements were incremental (but impressive for certain applications), this marked a distinct step for many (including me).
Was this the first time AI made headlines?</description>

      <description>Why do we have roles? People like naming things Upside It is easier to talk about categories or job levels then to always declare the full function or expertise of a person or group, i.e. &amp;ldquo;That task can be handled by one of the junior devs&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;That task can be handled by one of the devs that know our architecture, but are not yet experienced in the front end code&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <title>Vue Focus Handling</title>

      <description>Storytime i was working on a POC for multi factor authentication using time-based one time passwords (TOTP) and wanted to create a nice input UI for this, so i thought this would be a great way to practice my vue knowledge and create another showcase of vue for the team.
What i wanted was a UI like the one iOS uses, so 6 separate input boxes that are more or less handled like a normal input field but pretty ðŸ˜Š.</description>

      <description>Why? it all started with the blog post 8 Reasons Why You Should Blog as a Developer and especially the point about communicating clearly, which is becoming more and more important to me as my role shifts from &amp;ldquo;doer&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;enabler&amp;rdquo;. So it is more important to effectivly instruct others then doing stuff myself.
Additionally i wanted to explore static site generators, so this was the perfect way to do this.</description>

      <description>title: &amp;#34;Challenge 2023&amp;#34; date: 2023-02-16T21:08:00+02:00 tags: [&amp;#34;challenge&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;blog&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;getting shit together&amp;#34;] Why? It has been a loooong time since i last finished a post to my little blog. This is enough to think about the reasons why i wanted to start writing more. Those things still remain the same, so it all comes down to really doing what i wanted to do (aka the hardest part). So I&amp;rsquo;ll try to challenge myself to write a small amount of posts this year, and see if i can at least get this done.</description>

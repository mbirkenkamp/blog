      <description>Why do we have roles? People like naming things Upside It is easier to talk about categories or job levels then to always declare the full function or expertise of a person or group, i.e. &amp;ldquo;That task can be handled by one of the junior devs&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;That task can be handled by one of the devs that know our architecture, but are not yet experienced in the front end code&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Storytime i was working on a POC for multi factor authentication using time-based one time passwords (TOTP) and wanted to create a nice input UI for this, so i thought this would be a great way to practice my vue knowledge and create another showcase of vue for the team.
What i wanted was a UI like the one iOS uses, so 6 separate input boxes that are more or less handled like a normal input field but pretty ðŸ˜Š.</description>

      <description>Why? it all started with the blog post 8 Reasons Why You Should Blog as a Developer and especially the point about communicating clearly, which is becoming more and more important to me as my role shifts from &amp;ldquo;doer&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;enabler&amp;rdquo;. So it is more important to effectivly instruct others then doing stuff myself.
Additionally i wanted to explore static site generators, so this was the perfect way to do this.</description>
